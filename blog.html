        <h1>Ana Knezović's Blog</h1>
        <div>Hello everyone! I’m Ana Knezović, a proud Croatian native born on January 23, 2002, currently immersed in the world of Information and Communication Technologies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER) in Zagreb. I am excited to share with you my journey, a blend of rigorous academic training, a passion for languages, and a diverse array of hobbies.

A Foundation in Zagreb: My Educational Path
My academic journey began in the vibrant streets of Zagreb. I spent my elementary years at Osnovna škola Rudeš, a place where I first discovered my love for learning. This was followed by a transformative period at V. gimnazija, a secondary school that honed my analytical and critical thinking skills.

Currently, I am at FER, Zagreb, where I am delving deep into the fascinating world of Information and Communication Technologies. This field not only challenges my intellect but also satisfies my curiosity about how technology shapes our world.

A Polyglot in the Making
Languages are my window to the world. Besides my mother tongue, Croatian, I have achieved proficiency in English and German (C1 level in both), and I am comfortably conversant in French and Spanish (B2 level). This multilingual ability has opened up numerous doors for me, allowing me to connect with diverse cultures and perspectives.

Digital Skills: A Tech Enthusiast’s Toolbox
In today's digital era, one must be equipped with the right tools. I pride myself on my proficiency in various digital skills. From Microsoft Office Suite to programming languages like C, C++, Python, and JavaScript, I have a broad and continually expanding skill set. I am also skilled in SQL, video editing, and have hands-on experience with tools like Power BI and Excel.

Beyond the Classroom: Hobbies and Interests
Life, for me, is not just about academics and technology. I find joy and balance through my hobbies. Whether it's getting lost in a good book, staying active with jogging, strumming the guitar, or knitting, these activities keep me grounded and creative.

Accolades and Achievements
My journey has been punctuated with notable achievements. I hold immense pride in securing the 1st place in the national Croatian and Latin language competitions in 2016 and 2018, respectively. These accolades are a testament to my dedication and passion for languages.

Looking Forward
As I continue my educational journey and forge my path in the tech world, I remain committed to continuous learning and growth. With a driving license in hand and a zest for life, the possibilities seem limitless.

I hope my story inspires you to pursue your passions relentlessly and embrace the diverse opportunities life offers. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and stay tuned for more updates from my world!
